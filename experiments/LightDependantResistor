### Common Problems
-   [No lines shown on Oscilloscope](#troubleshoot_1)
-   [Voltage stays at 0V](#troubleshoot_2)

</div>
<div id="troubleshoot_1">

#### No lines shown on Oscilloscope
1. Make sure the PSLab is connected to the Android Phone
2. Try increasing the range to +/-16V

#### Voltage stays at 0V
1. Make sure that CH1 is connected to both the one leg of the LDR and one end of the 200Ω resistor
2. Make sure the PSLab is connected to the Android Phone
